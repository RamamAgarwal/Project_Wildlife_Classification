# Project_Wildlife_Classification

## Problem description
In this project, our goal is to classify the species that appear in camera trap images collected by our research partners at the Wild Chimpanzee Foundation and the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology. As mentioned in the about page, camera traps are one of the best tools available to study and monitor wildlife populations, and the enormous amounts of data they provide can be used to track different species for conservation efforts—once they are processed.

For our dataset, we have a trove of images from camera traps located in different sites around Taï National Park. There are seven types of critters captured in this set of images: birds, civets, duikers, hogs, leopards, other monkeys, and rodents. There are also images that contain no animals. Our job is to build a model that can help researchers predict whether an image contains one of these seven types of species.
